            <p>As many know, HSPPR has been serving our community for over 76 years. During that time, we have amassed a significant collection of physical archives, including documents, photographs, VHS tapes, slides, and more. As time passes, the risk of losing these materials increases. Natural disasters, such as wildfires and floods, could wipe out decades of our organization's history in an instant. This is why the archive team was created. We believe that preserving this history is essential to continually demonstrate our community impact, enhance employee morale, and learn from our past successes and mistakes to drive ongoing improvement within our organization.</p>
            <p>Our archiving project brings together the strengths of its three team members: Jason Stolz, Beth Conner, and Nathan Garcia. Nathan Garcia provided SharePoint administration, web development, and video editing expertise. Jason Stolz led archive discovery, scanning, and authored The Book. Beth Conner developed the indexing system, tagging schematics, and provided creative direction.</p>

            <p>The scanner used for this project is a high-resolution Epson Perfection V600 Photo Scanner, generously donated as an in-kind contribution. This scanner allows us to achieve the highest possible resolution, preserving the contextual integrity of our documents and photographs.</p>
            <p>The webpages are hosted on GitHub and feature in-house developed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, creating an interactive experience—especially for “The Timeline.” Graphics were provided by Lindsay Ross.</p>
            <p>Our indexing system follows best practices for schematic design, optimizing search and filtering functionality to ensure navigating the archives is as seamless as possible.</p>
            <p>We hope our viewers enjoy this project as much as we have enjoyed creating it. Please stay tuned for further developments.</p>
